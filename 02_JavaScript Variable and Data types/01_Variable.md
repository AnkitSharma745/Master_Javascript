# **Variables in JavaScript**

A variable in JavaScript is a container that holds a value. Think of it as a labeled box where you can store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Variables allow you to work with dynamic data in your programs.

JavaScript offers multiple ways to declare variables:

1. **`const`**
2. **`let`**
3. **`var`**
4. **Implicit (without a keyword)**

## **1. Declaring Variables**

### **Using `const`**

The `const` keyword is used to declare constants, meaning their values cannot be reassigned after initialization. They are **block-scoped**.

#### Characteristics:

- **Immutable Binding:** Once assigned, the reference cannot be changed.
- **Mandatory Initialization:** A value must be provided during declaration.
- **Mutability of Objects and Arrays:** While the reference cannot change, the contents of objects or arrays can be modified.

#### Example:

```javascript
const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14

// Cannot reassign
PI = 3.14159; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

// Objects and arrays
const person = { name: "Alice" };
person.name = "Bob"; // Allowed
console.log(person.name); // Output: Bob
```

---

### **Using `let`**

The `let` keyword is used to declare variables with **block scope**, and it allows reassignment of values.

#### Characteristics:

- **Block Scoped:** The variable is confined to the block `{}` where it is declared.
- **No Hoisting Before Initialization:** Cannot be accessed before declaration due to the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.

#### Example:

```javascript
if (true) {
  let age = 25;
  console.log(age); // Output: 25
}
console.log(age); // Error: age is not defined
```

---

### **Using `var`**

The `var` keyword is an older way to declare variables. Variables declared with `var` are either **function-scoped** or **global-scoped** and are **hoisted**.

#### Characteristics:

- **Function Scoped:** Accessible within the function where it is declared.
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
- **Not Block Scoped:** Unlike `let` and `const`, `var` ignores block scope.

#### Example:

```javascript
if (true) {
  var name = "John";
}
console.log(name); // Output: John
```

---

### **Using Nothing (Implicit Declaration)**

Variables can be declared without any keyword, which automatically makes them **global variables**. However, this is discouraged as it can lead to **variable leakage**.

#### Example:

```javascript
function test() {
  x = 10; // No keyword
}
test();
console.log(x); // Output: 10 (global variable)
```

---

## **2. Concepts Related to Variables**

### **2.1. Hoisting**

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the compile phase. However, only **declarations** are hoisted, not initializations.

#### Example (With `var`):

```javascript
console.log(a); // Output: undefined
var a = 10;
```

Here, the code is interpreted as:

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;
```

#### Example (With `let` or `const`):

```javascript
console.log(b); // Error: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;
```

---

### **2.2. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**

The **Temporal Dead Zone** refers to the period between entering the scope of a variable declared with `let` or `const` and its actual declaration. During this time, accessing the variable results in a `ReferenceError`.

#### Example:

```javascript
{
  console.log(x); // Error: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 5;
}
```

---

### **2.3. Shadowing**

Shadowing occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner variable **shadows** the outer variable within its scope.

#### Example:

```javascript
let x = 10;
{
  let x = 20; // Shadows outer x
  console.log(x); // Output: 20
}
console.log(x); // Output: 10
```

#### Special Case (With `var`):

`var` can shadow variables, but because it is not block-scoped, it can behave unpredictably:

```javascript
var y = 10;
{
  var y = 20; // Re-declares and overwrites outer y
  console.log(y); // Output: 20
}
console.log(y); // Output: 20
```

---

### **2.4. Variable Leakage**

Variable leakage happens when a variable declared implicitly becomes a global variable, often leading to unintended side effects.

#### Example:

```javascript
function testLeak() {
  leakyVar = "I leaked!";
}
testLeak();
console.log(leakyVar); // Output: I leaked! (global variable)
```

---

### **2.5. Block Scope vs. Function Scope**

- **Block Scope:** Variables declared with `let` and `const` are limited to the block `{}` in which they are declared.
- **Function Scope:** Variables declared with `var` are limited to the function in which they are declared.

#### Example:

```javascript
function test() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10; // Function-scoped
    let y = 20; // Block-scoped
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
  console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined
}
test();
```

---

### **2.6. Mutability of Variables**

- **`const` Variables:** The binding is immutable, but the contents of objects/arrays can change.
- **`let` and `var` Variables:** Both the binding and the contents can change.

#### Example:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed
console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = [5, 6]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

---

### **2.7. Best Practices for Variables**

1. Use `const` by default for values that do not change.
2. Use `let` for variables that need to change.
3. Avoid using `var` unless necessary (e.g., for legacy code).
4. Always declare variables to avoid implicit global variables.

### **3. Summary of Variable Scopes and Behaviors**

| **Feature**                 | **`var`**       | **`let`** | **`const`** |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Scope**                   | Function        | Block     | Block       |
| **Hoisting**                | Yes (undefined) | Yes (TDZ) | Yes (TDZ)   |
| **Reassignment**            | Yes             | Yes       | No          |
| **Re-declaration**          | Yes             | No        | No          |
| **Initialization Required** | No              | No        | Yes         |
