# Expression and Operator

#### A fragment of code that process a value is called an expression . Every value written literally is an expression.

### Types of operators in JavaScript

1. **Arithmetic Operator**: Performs mathematical operations such as `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division` on numerical values.

2. **Assignment Operator**: Assigns a value to a variable. It includes simple assignment as well as compound assignments like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.

3. **Increment/decrement Operator**: Increases or decreases the value of a variable by 1. `++` is used for incrementing and `--` for decrementing.

4. **Comparison Operators**: Compares two values and returns a Boolean result (true or false) based on the comparison. Examples include `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

5. **Ternary Operator**: Also known as the conditional operator, it assigns a value to a variable based on a condition. It is represented as `condition ? value1 : value2`.

6. **Logical Operator**: Performs logical operations on Boolean values. Examples include logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and logical NOT (!).

7. **TypeOf Operator**: Returns the data type of a variable or expression. It's used to determine the type of value being referred to.
