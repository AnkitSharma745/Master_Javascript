# Variables

Variable is a container which holds some value in it. For example, we store rice in a container as simple as a variable is.

In JavaScript, variables can be defined using four types:

## 1. Using `const`

```javascript
const y = 20; // Declaration and initialization
```

## 2. Using `let`

```javascript
let y = 20; // Declaration and initialization
```

## 3. Using `var`

```javascript
var y = 20; // Declaration and initialization
```

## 4. Using `nothing`

```javascript
 y = 20; // Declaration and initialization
```
